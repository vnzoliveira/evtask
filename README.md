## ðŸ’» Prerequisites
Before trying to run this web-app, there are some prerequisites that your
local machine must have:
* You need to have `Java SE Development Kit 11+` or a more recent version installed.

<hr>

## ðŸš€ Installing project dependencies
First, to run this webapp, as mentioned above, you need to install 1 core requisites.
Here you will find the installation guide to each of those requisites.

<br>

### â˜• JDK 17.0.1 installation guide
* to install `Java SE Development Kit 11+` you need to:<br><br>
    * Download the **JDK** file from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/archive/)
      <br><br>
    * Follow the installation menu from Java **JDK** and **DONE!**<br>

## ðŸŒ  Executing the web-app
By opening the project in **ANY IDE** and executing the Main.java class, the **Tomcat** server should
initialize normally at 8080 port. You can manually change in code in which port you want it to initialize.<br><br>
To facilitate this setup, I've created two shellscript files to handle this process and automatically build and deploy
the app. To do that, execute:
1. `deploy.bat`, in your terminal or by clicking inside the project folder, to run it on **Windows**.
2. `deploy_unix.sh`, in your terminal or through project folder, to run it on **UNIX BASED Systems, AKA Linux**.
3. To shut down the server, just close the terminal window that has opened.<br><br>
